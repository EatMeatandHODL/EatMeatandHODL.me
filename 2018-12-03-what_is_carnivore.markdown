### Carnivore or Zero Carb?
The carnivore diet, or as I prefer to say, way of eating is only eating meat and drinking water. You simply eat when you are hungry and eat until you are full. The good points of this are that there isnâ€™t any counting of calories, fat, carbs, or protein. (I despise having to count.)
There are some on this way of eating that say you can eat products from the animal such as cheese, eggs, cream, and butter. Some people still drink coffee and herbal tea because they find it too hard to give up. I say to this, it truly depends on the individual. I tried incorporating cheese, cream, and coffee and found my weight loss stalled. I think these types of eating are zero carb, but not true carnivore. My understanding of true carnivore is literally meat and water only.
