<p>This week has been an overload of stress to the point I wonder if my head is going to burst, and it's only Tuesday. On top of that the scale has been stuck at the same number for over a week. I know, I know, be patient. I have come so far, yet I want to be further. I thought I would already be at my goal weight by now, but my body decides when it wants to do what. I should have known this. I even signed up for healthy wage and bet some money I would be further than I am. Well, I am going to lose the amount I bet. Don't worry, it wasn't that big of an amount. I would have liked to have done it, but sometimes you just have to accept your body knows best. <p>

<p>Even though I haven't been happy with the scale, I am happy with something else. Normally this amount of stress would send me right to the bakery to pick up some cake and head home to have it in bed while watching movies to block it out. Today I am sipping a sparking water and am not even tempted in the least. I am sitting at Barnes and Noble and I can smell them heating things up and I still have no desire to eat anything carb laden. This is another huge victory for me. <p>

<p>Now to combat all the things casuing the stress, or maybe some meditation<p>
