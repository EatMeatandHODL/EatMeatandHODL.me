<p> This is way overdue and I know it.</p>

<p> I am officially at the six month mark. I have been quiet for a few reasons, one life has been very hectic and two, my weight loss stalled. For over a month my weight fluctuated between the same three pounds. I know this way of eating is not specifically for weight loss, but rather overall health. But, sometimes it can be disheartening. The nice thing is that people are still telling me that I look smaller and smaller, so I am happy about that. I am still proud of myself for not giving in to temptation as well. I did have one vodka shot and one glass of red wine at a celebration, but I have passed up on all the offers of sweets and catered meals offered to me. </p>

<p> Here is what happened last week between a coworker and myself:
Coworker: You have to try one of these almonds wrapped in white chocolate and lemon sugar.
Me: No thank you.
Coworker: Just one.
Me: No thanks. I have been doing great on my new eating plan.
Coworker: No one will know. It’s just one.
Me: No. Stop asking me. I will know and I don’t want to jeopardize how far I have come.
He hasn’t offered me anything else since that conversation. 
What I can report other than the weight stall is that my knees still feel amazing. I am still sleeping soundly and I need less of it. I am also not cringing when people want to take photos with me in them. I went out with friends last night and several of them wanted to take a group selfie. They sent me the picture and I was actually pleased with it and less critical of myself. I look like I have a neck again and my chin is more defined. Happy Dance!!
