<p> I am feeling a bit down.<p>

<p>
Before I begin, I wanted to acknowledge that it has been a while since I have posted. I am not the most technical person and some updates were made to the system I use for my site. I needed help getting this fixed. Shout out to my friend, Derek, for getting me all straightened out and continuously helping me with this site. <p>


<p>I have been feeling a bit frustrated lately. I hit the 11-month mark of this way of eating. Yay, right? In one sense, this is such an accomplishment for me, no sugar or carbs or me for almost an entire year. Don’t get me wrong, I am happy about it, but I am also frustrated because the scale is not moving. I keep reading blurbs where people lose a hundred pounds in months and almost a year later I am stuck at the 75-pound mark. I planned to be much further along by now. I wanted to be under 200 for my 41st birthday, but it isn’t going to happen. The scale has been on the exact same number for a couple of months. Not up or down a pound. Just static.<p>


<p>I have increased the amount of fat intake, and reduced the amount. I have tried meat, salt and water only. I tried OMAD and then TMAD. My body is not letting go for whatever reason. While I am happy for all of those folks out there dropping the pounds like it’s nothing, I am frustrated for my sake. I am not giving in though. I am still enjoying pain free knees, and better overall health. Plus, who wants Brussel Sprouts when you can eat steak and bacon? <p>


<p>Stay tuned, I will let you know how it goes when I weigh in again next month for my one year carniversary.<p>
