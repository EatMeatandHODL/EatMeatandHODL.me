<p> The above picture, that's my 60 day mark to 90 days.</p>

<p>It’s amazing how some days it feels like this is creeping by and other days I blink and a week has passed. I remember thinking just make it through today, and then make it through this week. Now it’s become the norm and I don’t have to focus on daily struggles. That’s not to say there aren’t temptations, but it’s getting so much easier to resist. I am down a total of 38 pounds, most of which I lost in the first two months. However, I did incorporate dairy and coffee in over Christmas so I knew I would stall. That is the great thing about this way of eating. You do truly learn to listen to your body. I know that even though I love both of those, they affect me negatively. </p>

<p>My body shape is still changing even if I am not losing weight as fast. My pants are getting lose and several of my shirts are now sleep shirts since they are too big. 
I have incorporated exercise as well. I bought a five pound kettlebell for strength training. I know it sounds like I’m a weakling, but do a full body workout with one of those for yourself. It will work you. I am also trying to walk a mile a day. Somedays are better than others but I can feel the muscles again. 
I am so glad I decided to get back on this and push through. I can’t wait to see what another 30 days brings.</p>
