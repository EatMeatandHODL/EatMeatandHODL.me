<div class="post"><h2 class="pageTitle">Four Months Complete</h2>

<p>I know I have been a little quiet the last month. I have had a lot going on and a few days I have felt a little down at times. However, I have stayed on plan and made it to four months. I am a few days past it actually. My total weight loss is at 47 pounds. I had hoped to be further than this, but it’s still a lot of weight I am no longer carrying. One day I spent 11 hours helping friends load and unload moving trucks and realized my knees did not hurt once. I don’t have a picture to attach to this post because my friend that was acting as my photographer moved away, but I will have one for my five month mark.</p>

<p>During this last month I have had some emotional down days. There have been many things going on and sometimes they can seem overwhelming. This is when the cravings hit hard. Even when I wasn’t hungry my brain kept saying “just have a small treat. It will make you feel better. You won’t gain it all back with just a few bites.” I even had a dream that I went to dinner with family and ate an entire chocolate and peanut butter pie. That isn’t even something I would pick, but my old demons were haunting me. I woke up feeling guilty as heck but so glad it was just a dream.  I did incorporate cheese three times as a small treat. Cheese is allowed on this plan, but it hinders me. All three times, I got sick. It was odd. I woke up in the middle of the night with stomach pain and the need to throw up. So cheese will no long be a treat for me. My body likes meat only.</p>

<p>I have been drinking Tazo Lemon Loaf herbal tea. It is a little like dessert, but not overly sweet. It gives me a sense of having a treat without stalling me. I also signed up for Healthy Wage. It’s a website that allows you to bet on yourself to earn money for losing weight. You calculate how much you want to wager each month and how much you want to lose. They then tell you how much you can earn if you hit your goal. Of course if you don’t hit the mark, you lose the money you wagered. If I meet my goal, which I did set a bit high, I will gain $850 dollars from them. Money is a great incentive to keep at this. I will let you know if I make it.</p>
