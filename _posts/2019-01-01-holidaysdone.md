Happy New Year, everyone! I made it through the holidays.

I am currently crashing at a friend’s house waiting for the weather to clear. I was supposed to fly out early this morning to head home, but Mother Nature had other ideas. What better time to do a recap of my travels and food temptations. 

So for the most part, it was easy to stay on plan. There was a bowl of nuts sitting on the counter that tempted me multiple times, but I stayed strong. Some cousins brought some goodies over, but I have that mindset right now that I have to make a change or that one cheat will lead to another year of me giving in and staying obese. My family did have lots of meat for me and no one pressured me. They did mention to make sure to drink plenty of water because they were concerned about my kidneys. I smiled and reassured them I was. 

I did allow myself five cups of coffee with heavy cream and some cheese over the course of almost two weeks. This was my “cheat” for the holidays, even though most carnivores allow it on a daily basis. While it is perfectly fine for others, I have learned it’s not for me. It caused some bloating and constipation. I also realized I have an addiction to cheese. Once I started having some, I found it harder and harder to say no, or not grab some when I was watching movies. 

By having these, I fell into my old ways of just eating because it’s breakfast time or because it was there. I wasn’t listening to my body. Coffee with butter or cream definitely interrupts my appetite triggers. So it’s back off coffee and dairy for me. As much as I love them, I love me more and have to push through this. I am not going to regret eating anything. It’s all part of learning to listen to your body. However, next year I plan to stick to my meat only plan. I don’t need cheats to be happy; spending time with those I love is what I need.

Cheers to a New Year and continuing to improve health. Stay strong everyone. We can do this.
