<h2 class="pageTitle">The violating screening</h2>

<div class="post">
    <p>It’s 5 am in the morning and I just went through TSA so I can fly home for Christmas. I am sure you are wondering why this would be relevant to a carnivore lifestyle. You see I generally fly a couple times a year and every time I go through the violating process of screening, my left knee always sets off the scanning area. I always get the extra pat down and sometimes they lift my pant leg to inspect it. I mentioned earlier in one of my blogs that my knee pain is gone. Going through the body scanner this morning was like a free little health check. I was clear of any targeted areas. For the first time my left knee wasn’t cause of suspicion. No pat down or pulling my pant leg up. Hallelujah.</p>

    <p>While I still am vehemently against the TSA it seems that eating like a carnivore is going to at least ease the process for me. This is just another reason for me to stay on this way of eating.</p>
