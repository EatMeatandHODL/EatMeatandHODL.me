<p>Y’all. I am so excited to tell you about this. Over Christmas, I was chomping down on a juicy ribeye. Being the graceful person I am, of course I drip some of the juice down the front of my shirt. I loved that shirt too. I treated it with shout and crossed my fingers. After washing and drying it the stain was still there. I was bummed and decided to keep it as an around the house shirt. </p>

<p>I was recently on Amazon shopping for laundry detergent (I despise going to the store). While browsing a link for a stain remover showed up in my feed. I thought why not try it? Amazon will take it back if I don’t like it. </p>

<p>The day I received it I got my shirt out and sprayed the stain. I let it sit for two days and then washed and dried it again. Amazing. The stain was gone! I can wear the shirt again. Woo hoo!
Here is the link if you would like to check it out:</p>

<p>I will be keeping this on hand as I know this is not the last time I get grease on my outfits.</p>
