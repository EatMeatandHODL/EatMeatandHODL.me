<h2 class="pageTitle">We can overcome this</h2>

<div class="post">

<p>Many people can’t understand why I chose to start this right before the holidays. A lot of them have said to wait and start in the New Year. However, for me it’s a now or never situation.</p>

<p>Yes, the holidays can be crippling for any person trying to eat healthy. Everywhere you turn, there is sugar. People are baking as if it’s the end of the world. Commercials show these super happy skinny people eating a chocolate bar or cakes. This year I had a student bring me a plate of homemade cookies, I received chocolate truffles, and candy canes as gifts and I travelled home, where I fell off the wagon last year.</p>

<p>I had to put myself in the mindset that no matter how good those things taste, my health and weight have to come first. Do I want the cookies, or do I want my joints to continue to heal? Being on this way of eating for just over 60 days is helping tremendously. The more you stay strong the easier it becomes to turn away from the temptations. I thanked the people that gave me the goodies as gifts, but immediately gave them to others to eat.</p>

<p>In my mind going to the grocers during the holidays is the equivalent of having multiple drug dealers in one place offering every addiction you have right at your fingertips. There are Christmas goodies everywhere and the smell of spices are overpowering. You just want to dig into that gingerbread cake and have that pumpkin latte. I walk right to the meat section and then to the register trying to avoid it all. But, even there you aren’t safe. The bags of cocoa and chocolates line the lanes. In order to help combat the temptation, either I get on my phone to read something and distract myself, or I do this slight bend at the knees repeatedly to remind myself that it used to be painful when I did that while eating junk food. It seems to help a lot. If you have another trick that works, please share.</p>

<p>I let people back home know that I am doing this and I want to stay on it through the trip. Luckily, I have a great group of friends and family. They may not understand why I am doing this, but they stocked up on meat and aren’t keeping goodies out on the counter. They will have sides to a meal but I can pass those up much easier. I will allow myself a small amount of coffee through the days but I know with it comes some consequences. When I go to others homes to visit I know there will be so much to overcome, but I have to make the change now, or I never will.</p>

<p>If you are just starting on this and you are struggling, know that you are not alone. Ask those in your life for support even if they don’t agree with it. If they argue just smile and know that you are bettering yourself and it’s worth it. (If you’re like me it’s also a little satisfying to prove them wrong in the long run.) Find an online group that you can turn to or even give me a shout on twitter [@eatmeatandhodl](https://twitter.com/EatMeatandHODL?lang=en)  I will give you support as much as I can.</p>

<p>I am going to take a small break from writing over the next week so I can focus on my family and friends. But, I will be back in the New Year to let you know how the rest of my trip unfolds. I wish all of you a Happy Christmas and New Year!</p>
