### I'm done with diets.
Have you ever started a diet and failed? Have you ever been so motivated and thought this is it, this time I am going to stick to it, only to stop two weeks in because a coworker brought in a box of cookies? This is the story of my life.

 I am a 40-year-old, obese woman who has tried diet after diet and failed. These diets include eating only cabbage soup, created for cardiac patients who need to lose weight quickly before going under the knife. The Mayo clinic diet, which was boring and left me feeling starved. I have tried calorie counting, reducing fat, limited size meals with vigorous exercise.  The list goes on. The best program I did well on was Dr. Atkins, low carbohydrate diet. However, it was difficult always-counting carbs and could easily miscount. I would struggle with depression and focusing so much on grocery lists, meal prep, getting exact ratios of carbs, fat, and protein that it became a chore. I always found myself making more the acceptable sweets, than nutritious food. 
 
 Last year I stumbled on a Facebook page of a woman doing a carnivore diet. Her before and after photos were incredible. I read her story and things started to make sense. I decided to try it. Meal prep was as easy as salting some meat and cooking it. I was not counting anything. You just ate when hungry and until full. I noticed that my knees started to feel better, I was sleeping better, and weight was coming off. You would think that this would have been all the motivation I needed. Nope, Christmas hit and I fell off the wagon. It continued month after month. I gained more weight and felt like crap. I had a trip to Europe planned and even that was not motivation enough to lose weight. I wanted my pizza and cookies. It’s so easy to give up and eat what you want, but I have to start thinking of food as fuel for my body and not just something used to cope with emotions or to eat out of boredom. As much as I love to eat pizza while watching Netflix, I can’t get healthy that way.

 I decided this time it has to be for life, not just another diet. My goal in having this blog is to keep myself accountable and to let others share in my experiences. I am not a medical professional and anything I post here is just my own self-experimentation and outcomes. I will be writing on various topics of concern and things that I find helpful. I will occasionally post progress photos and goals reached. If you have questions give me a shout out on Twitter [@EatMeatandHODL](https://twitter.com/EatMeatandHODL?lang=en).
