    <p>The above picture, that’s what a 60 day difference makes.</p>

    <p>When I started this, I put myself on a short timeline to see if I could do it. I told myself if I could make it to twenty days, I would be able truly take it and run with it. I decided to start right before Halloween, the best holiday ever. There was candy everywhere. Lord help me I wanted to dive into the Reese’s cups. Every person at work seemed to have a candy dish out to tempt me. However, I pushed through and made it to 20 days. After thirty days, I felt like I was starting to gain even more control. I won’t lie and say I’m not tempted, but I certainly find it easier to say no. Sweets have always been my downfall. On a low carb plan you still get to have them, so I couldn’t break the addiction. I was just using artificial sweetener instead of real sugar to feed it. With the carnivore way of eating, you don’t keep feeding the addiction. You learn to fuel your body when it needs it.</p>

    <p>There have been several noticeable changes I would like to share with you. I am down 32 pounds! Join me in a happy dance.  Of course, weight loss is my main goal, but there are a few others I found just as important that are worth talking about. For the first time I am learning to listen to my body. I know when I am truly hungry vs just eating because there is food available.</p>

    <p>I also want to talk about joints. My knees used to grind and pop constantly. If you were near me when walking up a flight of stairs, you could audibly hear them grind. This was pointed out by a friend one day when he said “Is that your knees?!”. Now I no longer have any grinding noises or popping. They no longer hurt when I lay in bed at night. That is a huge deal for me. I once watched a knee replacement surgery and I knew I never wanted to have that done. I believe staying on this way of eating will mean I never need one.</p>
    
    <p>Another thing that I find intriguing is that floater in my left eye is gone. If you have ever had floaters, you know how annoying they are. I no longer have that gray spot in the way of my vision. I didn’t expect that to happen but I am quite happy it has.</p>

    <p>I would say these first 60 days have been truly beneficial. I can’t wait to report back to you in another 60 days to see what has transpired. Stay tuned.</p>
