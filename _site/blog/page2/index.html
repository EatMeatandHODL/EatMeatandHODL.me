        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/blog/holidaysdone/">Post holidays follow up</a></h3>
        <p>Happy New Year, everyone! I made it through the holidays.

I am currently crashing at a friend’s house waiting for the weather to clear. I was supposed to fly out early this morning to head home, but Mother Nature had other ideas. What better time to do a recap of my travels and food temptations.

So for the most part, it was easy to stay on plan. There was a bowl of nuts sitting on the counter that tempted me multiple times, but I stayed strong. Some cousins brought some goodies over, but I have that mindset right now that I have to make a change or that one cheat will lead to another year of me giving in and staying obese. My family did have lots of meat for me and no one pressured me. They did mention to make sure to drink plenty of water because they were concerned about my kidneys. I smiled and reassured them I was.

I did allow myself five cups of coffee with heavy cream and some cheese over the course of almost two weeks. This was my “cheat” for the holidays, even though most carnivores allow it on a daily basis. While it is perfectly fine for others, I have learned it’s not for me. It caused some bloating and constipation. I also realized I have an addiction to cheese. Once I started having some, I found it harder and harder to say no, or not grab some when I was watching movies.

By having these, I fell into my old ways of just eating because it’s breakfast time or because it was there. I wasn’t listening to my body. Coffee with butter or cream definitely interrupts my appetite triggers. So it’s back off coffee and dairy for me. As much as I love them, I love me more and have to push through this. I am not going to regret eating anything. It’s all part of learning to listen to your body. However, next year I plan to stick to my meat only plan. I don’t need cheats to be happy; spending time with those I love is what I need.

Cheers to a New Year and continuing to improve health. Stay strong everyone. We can do this.

        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/blog/survivingtheholidays/">Surviving the holidays</a></h3>
        <p>We can overcome this



Many people can’t understand why I chose to start this right before the holidays. A lot of them have said to wait and start in the New Year. However, for me it’s a now or never situation.

Yes, the holidays can be crippling for any person trying to eat healthy. Everywhere you turn, there is sugar. People are baking as if it’s the end of the world. Commercials show these super happy skinny people eating a chocolate bar or cakes. This year I had a student bring me a plate of homemade cookies, I received chocolate truffles, and candy canes as gifts and I travelled home, where I fell off the wagon last year.

I had to put myself in the mindset that no matter how good those things taste, my health and weight have to come first. Do I want the cookies, or do I want my joints to continue to heal? Being on this way of eating for just over 60 days is helping tremendously. The more you stay strong the easier it becomes to turn away from the temptations. I thanked the people that gave me the goodies as gifts, but immediately gave them to others to eat.

In my mind going to the grocers during the holidays is the equivalent of having multiple drug dealers in one place offering every addiction you have right at your fingertips. There are Christmas goodies everywhere and the smell of spices are overpowering. You just want to dig into that gingerbread cake and have that pumpkin latte. I walk right to the meat section and then to the register trying to avoid it all. But, even there you aren’t safe. The bags of cocoa and chocolates line the lanes. In order to help combat the temptation, either I get on my phone to read something and distract myself, or I do this slight bend at the knees repeatedly to remind myself that it used to be painful when I did that while eating junk food. It seems to help a lot. If you have another trick that works, please share.

I let people back home know that I am doing this and I want to stay on it through the trip. Luckily, I have a great group of friends and family. They may not understand why I am doing this, but they stocked up on meat and aren’t keeping goodies out on the counter. They will have sides to a meal but I can pass those up much easier. I will allow myself a small amount of coffee through the days but I know with it comes some consequences. When I go to others homes to visit I know there will be so much to overcome, but I have to make the change now, or I never will.

If you are just starting on this and you are struggling, know that you are not alone. Ask those in your life for support even if they don’t agree with it. If they argue just smile and know that you are bettering yourself and it’s worth it. (If you’re like me it’s also a little satisfying to prove them wrong in the long run.) Find an online group that you can turn to or even give me a shout on twitter [@eatmeatandhodl](https://twitter.com/EatMeatandHODL?lang=en)  I will give you support as much as I can.

I am going to take a small break from writing over the next week so I can focus on my family and friends. But, I will be back in the New Year to let you know how the rest of my trip unfolds. I wish all of you a Happy Christmas and New Year!

        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/blog/tsa/">TSA</a></h3>
        <p>The violating screening


    It’s 5 am in the morning and I just went through TSA so I can fly home for Christmas. I am sure you are wondering why this would be relevant to a carnivore lifestyle. You see I generally fly a couple times a year and every time I go through the violating process of screening, my left knee always sets off the scanning area. I always get the extra pat down and sometimes they lift my pant leg to inspect it. I mentioned earlier in one of my blogs that my knee pain is gone. Going through the body scanner this morning was like a free little health check. I was clear of any targeted areas. For the first time my left knee wasn’t cause of suspicion. No pat down or pulling my pant leg up. Hallelujah.

    While I still am vehemently against the TSA it seems that eating like a carnivore is going to at least ease the process for me. This is just another reason for me to stay on this way of eating.

        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/blog/omad/">OMAD</a></h3>
        <p>One Meal A Day


    In the world of social media, there are tons and tons of acronyms for everything. The diet world is no exception.

    I stumbled across the OMAD term multiple times and was curious what it meant. I finally had to ask one of the groups. Here it is: One Meal A Day. That was simple. I started reading people’s comments and reasons for doing it. My understanding is that you end up fasting for 24 hours in between each meal. Fasting is a sensitive subject in the Facebook world of carnivores and zero carbers. I understand both sides of the argument and will write about it on another day.

    Back to the OMAD topic. I decided to try it to see how it affected my body and mental clarity. I started on a Friday and only ate lunch. I was definitely hungry by the time 1pm came around. I was able to skip dinner completely without any hunger. In fact, I didn’t experience hunger until around 2pm the next day. I ate until I was full and noticed again that I wasn’t hungry at dinner time. This continued on the rest of the week. The interesting part of this is that when I get home from work every day the first thing I do, is start cooking. It’s always been engrained in us that you have to eat three meals a day or five small ones to be healthy. Part of being carnivore is realizing that you have learn to eat when hungry. I thought I was doing that, but I was still clearly following eating patterns I had learned my entire life. OMAD was simple to follow and I was eating enough meat that I wasn’t hungry on the off hours. I decided to continue with it. I noticed on day 8 I didn’t eat enough at my meal and had to have some dinner that evening.

    I am no longer on the OMAD plan, but I am trying to truly listen to my body. Today I have only eaten one meal and I feel sated. My mental clarity remained constant throughout the trial and I even went for some long walks on those days without feeling famished. I don’t plan to do this again, but it really helped me learn to listen to my body.

        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/blog/sixtydaymark/">60 Days Complete</a></h3>
        <p>Before and After



    The above picture, that’s what a 60 day difference makes.

    When I started this, I put myself on a short timeline to see if I could do it. I told myself if I could make it to twenty days, I would be able truly take it and run with it. I decided to start right before Halloween, the best holiday ever. There was candy everywhere. Lord help me I wanted to dive into the Reese’s cups. Every person at work seemed to have a candy dish out to tempt me. However, I pushed through and made it to 20 days. After thirty days, I felt like I was starting to gain even more control. I won’t lie and say I’m not tempted, but I certainly find it easier to say no. Sweets have always been my downfall. On a low carb plan you still get to have them, so I couldn’t break the addiction. I was just using artificial sweetener instead of real sugar to feed it. With the carnivore way of eating, you don’t keep feeding the addiction. You learn to fuel your body when it needs it.

    There have been several noticeable changes I would like to share with you. I am down 32 pounds! Join me in a happy dance.  Of course, weight loss is my main goal, but there are a few others I found just as important that are worth talking about. For the first time I am learning to listen to my body. I know when I am truly hungry vs just eating because there is food available.

    I also want to talk about joints. My knees used to grind and pop constantly. If you were near me when walking up a flight of stairs, you could audibly hear them grind. This was pointed out by a friend one day when he said “Is that your knees?!”. Now I no longer have any grinding noises or popping. They no longer hurt when I lay in bed at night. That is a huge deal for me. I once watched a knee replacement surgery and I knew I never wanted to have that done. I believe staying on this way of eating will mean I never need one.
    
    Another thing that I find intriguing is that floater in my left eye is gone. If you have ever had floaters, you know how annoying they are. I no longer have that gray spot in the way of my vision. I didn’t expect that to happen but I am quite happy it has.

    I would say these first 60 days have been truly beneficial. I can’t wait to report back to you in another 60 days to see what has transpired. Stay tuned.
