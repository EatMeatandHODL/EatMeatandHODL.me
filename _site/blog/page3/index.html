        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/blog/what-is-carnivore/">What is Carnivore?</a></h3>
        <p>Carnivore or Zero Carb?



    If you were to join carnivore discussion groups you would see a lot of different opinions on what a carnivore diet, or what I prefer to call, way of eating is. Here is what I have determined from all of my reading and discussions with others. This is just my understanding and I am sure others would disagree, but here it is:

Carnivore is eating meat and drinking water. (Pink Himalayan salt for seasoning.)

Zero Carb is eating that which comes from the animal. It would primarily be meat, but allows eggs, cheese, and cream. Some folks allow seasonings, which have small amounts of carbs and coffee on this way of eating.

When I started, I used cheese, eggs, and cream. I found through my journaling that the cheese and cream were stalling my weight loss and affecting my judgement to tell if I was truly hungry. I cut those out and the weight started to come off again. I was no longer reaching for the cheese as a snack out of boredom. I stopped eating eggs just to see how it affected me. I didn’t see a huge difference, but when I added them back in, surprisingly the scale went up again. Now I am back to just meat and water. I think every person has to find what is right for him or her and run with it. The one thing I think we can all agree on is that even though carbs taste heavenly, they are in fact of the devil.

I'm done with diets

    Have you ever started a diet and failed? Have you ever been so motivated and thought this is it, this time I am going to stick to it, only to stop two weeks in because a coworker brought in a box of cookies? This is the story of my life.

    I am a 40-year-old, obese woman who has tried diet after diet and failed. These diets include eating only cabbage soup, created for cardiac patients who need to lose weight quickly before going under the knife. The Mayo clinic diet, which was boring and left me feeling starved. I have tried calorie counting, reducing fat, limited size meals with vigorous exercise.  The list goes on. The best program I did well on was Dr. Atkins, low carbohydrate diet. However, it was difficult always-counting carbs and could easily miscount. I would struggle with depression and focusing so much on grocery lists, meal prep, getting exact ratios of carbs, fat, and protein that it became a chore. I always found myself making more the acceptable sweets, than nutritious food.

    Last year I stumbled on a Facebook page of a woman doing a carnivore diet. Her before and after photos were incredible. I read her story and things started to make sense. I decided to try it. Meal prep was as easy as salting some meat and cooking it. I was not counting anything. You just ate when hungry and until full. I noticed that my knees started to feel better, I was sleeping better, and weight was coming off. You would think that this would have been all the motivation I needed. Nope, Christmas hit and I fell off the wagon. It continued month after month. I gained more weight and felt like crap. I had a trip to Europe planned and even that was not motivation enough to lose weight. I wanted my pizza and cookies. It’s so easy to give up and eat what you want, but I have to start thinking of food as fuel for my body and not just something used to cope with emotions or to eat out of boredom. As much as I love to eat pizza while watching Netflix, I can’t get healthy that way.

    I decided this time it has to be for life, not just another diet. My goal in having this blog is to keep myself accountable and to let others share in my experiences. I am not a medical professional and anything I post here is just my own self-experimentation and outcomes. I will be writing on various topics of concern and things that I find helpful. I will occasionally post progress photos and goals reached. If you have questions give me a shout out on Twitter [@EatMeatandHODL](https://twitter.com/EatMeatandHODL?lang=en).

    I would also like to make a comment about my page name. I am sure you are wondering what HODL means. It stands for Hold On for Dear Life. This was actually taken from the Bitcoin world, which is another topic I plan to write about on here in the future. But I think it applicable to carnivory, because once you truly adapt this way of eating you may experience a lot of changes.
