        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/blog/Travel/">Staying Carnivore while travelling</a></h3>
        <p> It is possible to stay on plan.

I am currently on vacation and realize that I haven't posted in a while. First, let's talk about some food options. The first leg of the trip my friend and I drove about 2000 miles. Now, you're going to get hungry during that time and not going to want to stop for a steak each time. Well, I would love to stop for a steak each time, but time and money wouldn't allow that.

One of the two things we packed were dried parmesan crisps from Sam's Club. Now, I really need to cut dairy out but it was a convienent way to have something if we didn't want to stop. I also packed some Country Archer beef sticks, which I find to be the best option of beef sticks since they don't have the additives like most. Neither of them needed refigeration and I was good with that. But let's be honest, you just don't fill up on cheese crisps and beef sticks. So two good places to stop or go through the drive through are Wendy's and McDonald's.

If you go to McDonald's ask to order the quarter pound beef patty from the Alacarte menu. They range in price depending on which one you go to. The most I have paid is there is $1.69 a patty. Now, these do in a pinch but I find them to have a funny taste. The top is usually cooked well but the bottom is soggy. I have found I much prefer the taste of Wendy's. Just tell them you want to order plain large beef patties. They are cooked thouroughly and much more tasty. My guess is becasue they don't freeze their patties like McDonald's does. Something to note with Wendy's is that if you don't ask them to put the patties all in one container, you will get them all individually in a plastic box. I learned this the hard way.

My friend has his dog on a carnivore way of eating as well, so this was great for us.I ordered some patties for all of us, including the dog. Very convienent and we didn't have to put him on kibble for trip. Now of course you can stop and eat at about most restaurants, just order meat without the sides. I always get funny looks and they keep asking if I want sides, but generally most places will accomodate. Some will even give you a discounted price, but some won't. You just have to be prepared to pay full price but happy if they give one. As far as Wendy's pricing goes, the most I have paid is $1.59 a patty. It generally takes three of them to fill me up, but if I am ravenous, I can do four. That's a pretty cheap meal. I do recommend keeping some salt with you. I always need to add some.

One other thing you are going to run into is people that are not carnivore still follow traditional eating habits. Meaning they don't understand that you need more meat to fill up. They will give you a small cut of meat just like they have, but then they have all the sides so they are full. You have to speak up and explain it to them.

So you can stay carnivore while travelling, you just have to plan ahead, and speak up. I flew home instead of driving. At the airport I was able to find a bbq joint and they gave me a discount for ordering just the meat. Score! The best part of the flight home was that I had so much extra room with the seatbelt. This way of eating is truly healing me and making my life so much better. To those of you who might be travelling soon, you can still stick to it! I have confidence in you.

        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/blog/6monthmark/">Six Month Mark</a></h3>
        <p>Six Month Mark



 This is way overdue and I know it.

 I am officially at the six month mark. I have been quiet for a few reasons, one life has been very hectic and two, my weight loss stalled. For over a month my weight fluctuated between the same three pounds. I know this way of eating is not specifically for weight loss, but rather overall health. But, sometimes it can be disheartening. The nice thing is that people are still telling me that I look smaller and smaller, so I am happy about that. I am still proud of myself for not giving in to temptation as well. I did have one vodka shot and one glass of red wine at a celebration, but I have passed up on all the offers of sweets and catered meals offered to me. 

 Here is what happened last week between a coworker and myself:

 Coworker: You have to try one of these almonds wrapped in white chocolate and lemon sugar.

 Me: No thank you.

 Coworker: Just one.

 Me: No thanks. I have been doing great on my new eating plan.

 Coworker: No one will know. It’s just one.

 Me: No. Stop asking me. I will know and I don’t want to jeopardize how far I have come.

 He hasn’t offered me anything else since that conversation. 
What I can report other than the weight stall is that my knees still feel amazing. I am still sleeping soundly and I need less of it. I am also not cringing when people want to take photos with me in them. I went out with friends last night and several of them wanted to take a group selfie. They sent me the picture and I was actually pleased with it and less critical of myself. I look like I have a neck again and my chin is more defined. Happy Dance!!

        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/blog/fourmonths/">Four Months Complete</a></h3>
        <p>Four Months Complete

I know I have been a little quiet the last month. I have had a lot going on and a few days I have felt a little down at times. However, I have stayed on plan and made it to four months. I am a few days past it actually. My total weight loss is at 47 pounds. I had hoped to be further than this, but it’s still a lot of weight I am no longer carrying. One day I spent 11 hours helping friends load and unload moving trucks and realized my knees did not hurt once. I don’t have a picture to attach to this post because my friend that was acting as my photographer moved away, but I will have one for my five month mark.

During this last month I have had some emotional down days. There have been many things going on and sometimes they can seem overwhelming. This is when the cravings hit hard. Even when I wasn’t hungry my brain kept saying “just have a small treat. It will make you feel better. You won’t gain it all back with just a few bites.” I even had a dream that I went to dinner with family and ate an entire chocolate and peanut butter pie. That isn’t even something I would pick, but my old demons were haunting me. I woke up feeling guilty as heck but so glad it was just a dream.  I did incorporate cheese three times as a small treat. Cheese is allowed on this plan, but it hinders me. All three times, I got sick. It was odd. I woke up in the middle of the night with stomach pain and the need to throw up. So cheese will no long be a treat for me. My body likes meat only.

I have been drinking Tazo Lemon Loaf herbal tea. It is a little like dessert, but not overly sweet. It gives me a sense of having a treat without stalling me. I also signed up for Healthy Wage. It’s a website that allows you to bet on yourself to earn money for losing weight. You calculate how much you want to wager each month and how much you want to lose. They then tell you how much you can earn if you hit your goal. Of course if you don’t hit the mark, you lose the money you wagered. If I meet my goal, which I did set a bit high, I will gain $850 dollars from them. Money is a great incentive to keep at this. I will let you know if I make it.

        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/blog/greasestains/">Grease Stains</a></h3>
        <p>

Carnivores understand

Y’all. I am so excited to tell you about this. Over Christmas, I was chomping down on a juicy ribeye. Being the graceful person I am, of course I drip some of the juice down the front of my shirt. I loved that shirt too. I treated it with shout and crossed my fingers. After washing and drying it the stain was still there. I was bummed and decided to keep it as an around the house shirt. 

I was recently on Amazon shopping for laundry detergent (I despise going to the store). While browsing a link for a stain remover showed up in my feed. I thought why not try it? Amazon will take it back if I don’t like it. 

The day I received it I got my shirt out and sprayed the stain. I let it sit for two days and then washed and dried it again. Amazing. The stain was gone! I can wear the shirt again. Woo hoo!
Here is the link if you would like to check it out:



    

I will be keeping this on hand as I know this is not the last time I get grease on my outfits.

        <h3><a class="post-link" href="/blog/90daymark/">90 Days Complete</a></h3>
        <p>90 days



 The above picture, that's my 60 day mark to 90 days.

It’s amazing how some days it feels like this is creeping by and other days I blink and a week has passed. I remember thinking just make it through today, and then make it through this week. Now it’s become the norm and I don’t have to focus on daily struggles. That’s not to say there aren’t temptations, but it’s getting so much easier to resist. I am down a total of 38 pounds, most of which I lost in the first two months. However, I did incorporate dairy and coffee in over Christmas so I knew I would stall. That is the great thing about this way of eating. You do truly learn to listen to your body. I know that even though I love both of those, they affect me negatively. 

My body shape is still changing even if I am not losing weight as fast. My pants are getting lose and several of my shirts are now sleep shirts since they are too big. 
I have incorporated exercise as well. I bought a five pound kettlebell for strength training. I know it sounds like I’m a weakling, but do a full body workout with one of those for yourself. It will work you. I am also trying to walk a mile a day. Somedays are better than others but I can feel the muscles again. 
I am so glad I decided to get back on this and push through. I can’t wait to see what another 30 days brings.
